# dlrc17-gdk

Project Repository for Team 'Great Dolphins Kaboom'

This repository only contains the code we used in the very end, and lots of stale code has been removed. Still, no garantuees that anything runs or is documented at all.

If you want to learn more about the Deep Learning and Robotics Challenge 17 and our approach, feel free to check our [competition blog](http://dlrc.pages.argmax.ai/blog/gdk/) (Also check the other teams, they did some pretty cool stuff as well!)

# Hardware
This code was run on Lego Mindstorm EV3, Nvidia Jetson TX-2s and additional webcams (PS3 eye). Additionally, we accessed the computing power of a workstation with a GTX1080, and the DGX-1 cluster.

# Software
All python (for Jetson onboard camera some additional drivers need to be compiled). The following requirements were automatically generated with pipreqs. Don't put any faith in it.

 * matplotlib==1.5.3
 * tensorflow_gpu==1.3.0
